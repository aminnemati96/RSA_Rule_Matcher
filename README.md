# RSA_Rule_Matcher
Implementing secure rule matcher using RSA cryptosystem (OPES)
A Rule matcher is a system that is able to evaluate packet matching rules in unsecure environments without revealing the signatures or what network traffic is being matched by those signatures. The details of this system is explained in my thesis. The link to my thesis can be found on my LinkedIn.
